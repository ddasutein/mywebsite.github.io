	Hi there!

	Thanks for stopping by my blog.

	Allow me to introduce myself, the name is Dustin. Dasutein, or ダステイン is my Japanese name. And no, I am not Japanese in case you were wondering. I was born in the Philippines and raised in the United States territory called Guam.<br>

	<b>INTERESTS AND HOBBIES</b><br>
	I’ve been into Computers and Technology around the age of 5. I used to tinker around with a lot of electronics in my home and learning how they work, and how to fix them. Today, I love Technology more than ever.<br><br>

	I enjoy Video Games, but not as much as I used to since starting College. However, I’m quite active in a mobile rhythm game called, Love Live! School Idol Festival.

	For entertainment? Anime and YouTube are my main source for entertainment. If you are wondering what my favorite anime is, it is, Love Live! School Idol Project.<br><br>

	<b>PORTFOLIO AND OTHER WORKS</b><br>
